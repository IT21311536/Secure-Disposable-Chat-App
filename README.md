# AnonChat ðŸ˜Ž
AnonChat is a secure chat app meant to have disposable conversations anonymously built using the `Python-flask framework`. This has secure features such as end-to-end encryption and once the chat-room session is disposed all the messages will be deleted and no message/session data is stored at the server end as there is no database connected to the application. This is not meant for default usage of a chat application but only to be used when privacy is a concern.
